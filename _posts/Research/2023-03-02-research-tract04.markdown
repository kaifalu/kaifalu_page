<h2>{{"Overview"}}</h2>
[Transportation and Environment](https://transportgeography.org/contents/chapter4/transportation-and-environment/) is the collection of environmental impacts of transportation systems, from infrastructures to vehicle operations, ranging from noise, the emission of pollutants to climate change. In this track, we aim to investigate environmental analysis of transportation infrastructure and environmental evaluation of transportation policy as follows:
<li>{{ "Urban Viadict" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Traffic Restriction Policy" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Field Measurement" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Numerical Simulation" }}</li>
