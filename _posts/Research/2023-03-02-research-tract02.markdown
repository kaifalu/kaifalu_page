<h2>{{"Overview"}}</h2>
[Urban Resilience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_resilience) is an emerging discipline to study the ability of an urban system-and all its constituent socio-ecological and socio-technical networks across temporal and spatial scales-to maintain or rapidly return to desired functions in the face of a disturbance, to adapt to change, and to quickly transform systems that limit current or future adaptive capacity ([Meerow et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.11.011)). In this track, we focus on resilience of urban transportation network to investigate the impact of extreme weather events on urban mobility system as follows:
<li>{{ "Vulnerability Assessment Approach" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Transportation Network Resilience" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Characterization of Mobility Resilience" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Prediction of Mobility Resilience" }}</li>
