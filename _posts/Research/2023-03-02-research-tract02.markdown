[Microtransit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransit) and [Micromobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromobility) are two emerging modes of transportation to provide nearby commuters and residents with an alternative micro-mobility option, particularly over first mile and last mile. One of the design goals of microtransit and micromobility systems is to extend the geographical and demographic reach that the existing public transit network cannot cover. In this track, I aim to investigate the impact of microtransit and micromobility systems on transportation landscape and urban mobility:
<li>{{ "Usage Pattern Analysis" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Demand Modelling & Prediction" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Relationship with Public Transit" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Transportation Infrastructure Planning" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Microtransit & Micromobility System Evaluation" }}</li>
