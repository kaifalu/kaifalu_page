[Urban Planning AI](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0739456X231180568) is the process of plan-making that is conducted, either partially or entirely, by an AI agent during the urban planning process. Specifically, an Urban Planning AI agent can encompass various computer programs or systems created to assist or automate different tasks involved in the planning process, similar to ChatGPT, enabling planners to make more informed and effective decisions ([Peng et al, 2023](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0739456X231180568)). With different levels of AI involvement in the planning process, urban planning AI spans from initial AI-assisted plan-making to fully automated plan-making:
<li>{{ "Plan-making Optimization & Automation" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Spatial Data Analysis" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Machine Learning & Deep Learning" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Deep Reinforcement Learning" }}</li>
