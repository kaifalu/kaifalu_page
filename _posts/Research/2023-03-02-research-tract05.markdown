<h2>{{"Overview"}}</h2>
[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) is a field of inquiry devoted to understanding and building methods that "learn" â€“ that is, methods that leverage data to improve performance on some set of tasks. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In this track, we aim to present primary modeling paradigms of machine learning and deep learning in urban applications as follows:
<li>{{ "Machine Learning in Urban Analytics" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Machine Learning for Time Series" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Neural Network and Deep Learning" }}</li>
<li>{{ "Signal and Systems" }}</li>
