<h2>{{"Overview"}}</h2>
[Urban Planning AI](https://carto.com/blog/urban-analytics-introduction-spatial-analytics#:~:text=Urban%20analytics%20is%20the%20practice%20of%20using%20new,the%20local%20and%20global%20environment%2C%20and%20much%20more) is the practice of using new forms of data in combination with computational approaches to gain insight into urban processes and increasing data availability allows us to ask new and often complex questions about cities, their economy, how they relate to the local and global environment, and much more. In this track, we aim to present some primary modeling paradigms to analyze cities with an emphasis on analytical perspectives and urban applications, so as to provid future urban planners, designers, and engineers the critical analytical capacity to understand cities and address upcoming urban challenges:
