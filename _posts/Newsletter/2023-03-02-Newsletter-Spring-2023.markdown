Second-year Ph.D. student Kaifa Lu, under the supervision of Dr. Zhong-Ren Peng, has recently presented his research "Characterization and prediction of mobility resilience in transportation network: A spatiotemporal graph diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network approach" at Transportation Research Board 102nd Annual Meeting, Washington D.C., 2023. Also, he published another research <em>"Impacts of viaduct and geometry configurations on the distribution of traffic-related particulate matter in urban street canyon"</em>[[Text]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.159902) at Science of The Total Environment.
